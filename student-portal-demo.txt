# student-portal-demo

This is a basic student portal application designed for students to:

- Register and log in to their profile
- View academic records and attendance
- Submit assignments
- Receive announcements and notifications from faculty
- Access study materials and exam schedules

The goal is to provide a centralized system for students and faculty to interact efficiently.
